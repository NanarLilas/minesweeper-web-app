let's type a plan here for each sheet:

on load: (js&jsom?)
-get name (done)
-get level (beginner (size & #mines), intermediate(size & #mines) and advanced (size & #mines))(done)
-start (done?)
-load from JSON(done?)

while playing:(js ?)(done)
-if minimize or other tab stop timer
-if max and on tab continue timer

html:
-header -> display game title
-Main area -> where gameboard will be genrated
-Sidebar -> display top 3 record
-Footer -> include copyright or information

css:
-basic styling for the 4 elemnts at the start
-refine later


js: (talia)
-reveal mines when win (done)
-update scores (done)
-Generate based on difficulty chosed (on-click) (done)
-Handle revealing sqares and mines (empty, number or mine)(done)
-flag cells for potential mines(done)
-flag all mines when game is won and diplay message + score check + timer stop (Done)
-display message if lost (done)
-score check + timer stop + option to replay  
-if fagged wrong replace with X
-load scores from JSON (Done)

JSON: no longer needed! store in cache of browser
-update scores(not feasible?) => not write physically, store in the memory of browser => local storage teacher in browser => turn off will reset
-each board with its specs and highscores(done?)


things to fix:
-Expert level is not responsive.
-Instead of using alert we can use popup (optional).


-change the update and fetch from json to set and get items from local storage or update on html  (done)
-create list in side bar (beginner, intermediate, expert) (done)
-Show name of the user. (done) 
-when i added the submit it stopped checking for names if input or not T-T (done)



-user and submit button are making me go insane

-heyy I have an exam on monday so i'll continue working on it after the exam. Do whatever is easy for you and i'll work on the rest!
